# Ruedenberg's Slater-Type Atomic Orbitals Overlap

This Python notebook computes Slater-type orbital overlap integrals using Ruedenberg's overlap integrals. Moreover, it tests the results by comparing to Roothan's overlap integrals. 

This code will be implemented for later use in BEBOP to calculate $\sigma$, $\pi$, and $\delta$ bonding of systems beyond first-row elements. 

## Installation
